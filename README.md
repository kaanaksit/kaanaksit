ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Kaan AkÅŸit. I am a scientist curious about computational methods related to light.
The computational models I have invented so far have helped me build screen technologies that could become an integral part of our lives in the future. 
My intention in all this is to free all human beings from standing still in front of a screen and provide realistic images that could augment their real world.
My research relies on my toolkit, [GitHub:kaanaksit/odak](https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak).
