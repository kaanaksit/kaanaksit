ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Kaan AkÅŸit. I am a scientist curious about computational methods related to light.
These models have helped me build screen technologies that could become an integral part of our lives in the future. 
My intention in all this is to free all human beings from standing still in front of a screen and provide realistic images that could augment their real world while providing them greater mobility and accessibility.
I use my toolkit, [GitHub:kaanaksit/odak](https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak), in my research.
It is free and open-source, if you like you can use or contribute.

If you like to learn more about me, please visit [my website](https://kaanaksit.com) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaanaksit).
