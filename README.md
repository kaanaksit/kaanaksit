ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Kaan AkÅŸit. I am a scientist curious about computational models related to light.
These models have helped me invent immersive computational display methods for the next generation display technologies. 
I intend to free all human beings from standing still in front of a screen and provide realistic images that could augment their real world while providing greater mobility and accessibility.
I use my open-source toolkit, [GitHub:kaanaksit/odak](https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak), in my research.
If you like my toolkit, you can use it freely and contribute.

If you would like to learn more about me, please visit [my website](https://kaanaksit.com) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaanaksit).
If you find my causes research worthy, please consider supporting my work through [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/kaanaksit).
