ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Kaan AkÅŸit. I am a scientist curious about computational methods related to light.
The computational models that I invented so far helped me build screen technologies that could one day become a part of our lives. 
My intention in all of this is to free all human beings from standing still in front of a screen and provide them realistic images that could augment their real world.
For all this research, I rely on my toolkit, [GitHub:kaanaksit/odak](https://github.com/kaanaksit/odak).
